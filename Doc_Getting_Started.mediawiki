= Getting Started =
This page will help you to get started with EWF. We will first see how to install EWF and then how to compile and run the venerable Hello World example.

== Installation ==
=== EiffelStudio 7.2 ===
EWF is already included in EiffelStudio 7.2: you don't have to do anything in this case! This is the recommanded solution if you are a new developer or are new to Eiffel.

=== Other EiffelStudio versions ===
If you have another version of EiffelStudio than 7.2, you have to

* dowload EWF
* create a directory where you will put your custum Eiffel libraries
* extract EWF in the newly created directory
* define the environment variable EIFFEL_LIBRARY to point to the newly created directory

=== Source code ===
The source code is available on Github. You can get it by running the command:

:    git clone git://github.com/EiffelWebFramework/EWF.git
